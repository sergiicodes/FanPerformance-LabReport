## Thermal-Fluids Laboratory: ME 4251-502

---

## Abstract

The experiment aims to evaluate the performance of a fan by measuring various parameters like head, airflow, and power in Watts. The fan's performance was observed at different speeds, measured in hertz (Hz) and revolutions per minute (RPM). The study found that as the fan speed increased, the airflow also increased, leading to various changes in other parameters like heat and power.

## Objective

To understand the relationship between fan speed, airflow, and other performance metrics. The experiment also aims to validate the efficiency laws stated by the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) and NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Association).

## Methods

### Equipment Utilized
- Variable Power Supply
- LabVIEW system
- U-tube Manometers

### Procedure
The fan is powered at different frequencies, and various metrics like temperature, pressure, and brake horsepower are recorded.

---

## Results & Discussion

- The experiment found that as the fan speed increased, the airflow also increased.
- The fan's efficiency increased until it reached a global maximum, after which it reduced.
- The fan operated within the guidelines provided by IEC and NEMA.

## Conclusion

The experiment successfully characterized the fan's performance and validated the efficiency laws. It also identified the optimal operating point for the fan.
